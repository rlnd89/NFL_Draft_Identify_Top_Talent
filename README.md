# Identifying Top Talent
## Predicting a player’s talent and draft position using NFL Combine measurements, individual and team college data

**Capstone project for DataRobot 10X: Applied Data Science Academy**

**Problem Background:**
NFL is a billion-dollar industry, the biggest league in the world by revenue The NFL Draft is the best opportunity for teams to improve and stack young, inexpensive talent for years. 
  

**Problem Statement**
Teams spend a lot of money to identify and select top talent, however, the NFL draft is not exact science:
- 11% of players selected never play a game
- 50% of players selected never become primary starters
- 35% of players selected don’t live up to expectations
- $9M spent on contracts for unsuccessful draft class per team


**Questions**
- What are the key metrics to identify top prospects?
- How can teams improve their ROI by selecting the right players?


**Solution**
Building a model with the DataRobot platform to identify top college talent and predict their draft positions. Goals:
- Evaluate draft prospects and provide an unbiased draft grade: Probability for each player of which round they would be selected. Results can be incorporated into team’s draft rankings and strategies (it can allow them to target a particular player or trade for a draft pick)
- Give an estimate when a player gets selected: Probability for each player of which round they would be selected. Results can be incorporated into team’s draft rankings and strategies (it can allow them to target a particular player or trade for a draft pick)


**Project main steps:**
1. Build web scrapers in Python to collect data
2. Clean and transform data in Python and SQL
3. Build machine learning models with DataRobot App
4. Evaluate and improve models
